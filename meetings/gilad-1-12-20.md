# Meeting Notes

> 1.12.2020, meeting with gilad discussing definitions of emotion and affect and how to measure them in experiments.

### Definitions of emotions and affect

We discussed the definitions of affect and emotion, we decided that the most important dimensions to consider for affect were valance(positive-negative) and arousal,
which can be mapped to the normal emotions we are used to. This definition of emotion is very philosophical and not set in stone, that's why the most important thing
is to be consistent with the definitions we use.

### Data Gathering and Expiriments
We discussed the validity of two data gathering approaches, a controlled experiment where the subject's emotions are artificially induced with a movie for example, and an "out in the wild" experiment where the subject installs our software in their home computer and the software will ask for emotion labels every set amount of time for a few weeks. 
We decided that in general, the out in the wild experiment is more informative, even though it can be harder to collect data in this way.
We will consider a controlled experiment for collecting image data because the out in the wild experiment won't be able to record all the time due to data size constraints.
