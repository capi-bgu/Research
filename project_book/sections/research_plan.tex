\subsection{Goals}
Our project has two core goals. The first is to develop a model or a collection of models that will build on existing research in
the fields of affective computing, facial expression recognition, and keyboard and mouse dynamics, implementing ideas across these
three fields into a unified model for emotion recognition.
The second goal is to create a platform that will ease the creation of personalized machine learning software.
The platform will be as implementation-independent as possible to allow the easy integration of research in this field.
The platform will provide utilities that will be necessary for any method trying to create personalized models,
such as data gathering and labeling.
